# Continuous Delivery

## What is Continuous Delivery?

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested and prepared for a release to production. It aims at building, testing and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. The approach helps reduce the time it takes to get feedback and verify changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production.

- Pipeline: esteira de execução
- Steps: estapas de execução sequenciais synchronous
- Jobs: conjuntos de steps asynchronous
- Agente: máquina ou container em que o pipeline executa
