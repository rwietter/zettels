# Docker

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. Containers are created from images that specify their precise contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from public repositories.

### Commands

#### Docker info

- `docker images`: list all images
- `docker ps`: list running containers

#### Build image

- `docker build -t <image-name> .`: build image from Dockerfile in current directory
- `docker build -t <image-name> <path-to-dockerfile>`: build image from Dockerfile in specified directory

#### Executing commands in a container

- `docker exec -it <alpine-container-id> sh`: run alpine image in interactive mode container
- `docker exec -it <container> /bin/bash`: run bash in container (if bash is installed)


---

### Dockerfile

Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

#### Dockerfile example

```dockerfile
FROM node:12.18.3-alpine3.9 # base image

WORKDIR /app # set working directory

COPY package.json . # copy package.json to working directory

RUN npm install # install dependencies

COPY . . # copy all files to working directory

EXPOSE 3000 # expose port 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"] # run command
```
