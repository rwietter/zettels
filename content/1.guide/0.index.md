Hi! My name is **Maur√≠cio Witter** a.k.a **rwietter**. I'am a software developer, I love to learn new things and share my
knowledge with others. Learn in public is one of my favorite things to do, I believe that sharing knowledge is the best
way to learn. I'm a big fan of open source and I'm always trying to contribute to the community.

I'm currently studying Information Systems at the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) and I'm working as a
freelancer developer. Developing web applications and applications for mobile devices are my main areas of expertise.

I have been working with web development since 2020, I started with C programming language and then I moved to
JavaScript and Typescriot. I have experience with Node.js, React, React Native, Vue.js, Svelte.js, Postgres, SQL,
Prisma.js, Docker and other technologies.

I'm also a big fan of Linux, I use it as my main operating system and I'm always trying to learn more about it. I'm
currently using Arch Linux as my main operating system. I also use Arch Linux on my servers and I'm always trying to
learn more about Linux and open source. As User Interface I use Awesome WM, I love it because it's very customizable and
it's very fast, lightweight, adaptative and it's very easy to use.
